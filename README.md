# Kattis

I have made some Kattis task in cpp. It's updating for time to time when I do more task.

## Other

In here I have the work me and https://github.com/simonsejse have done, aswell as some adventure of code.

## What I use

For most of the task:

- cph extension both chrome and vscode to easily access the problem and get test cases.
- snippets extension where it allows me to easierly make a template of my choice.
- Lastly I use my python scipt to move the .cpp files over in the done folder and temporary in the extra_copy folder to easily check the last assignment I did.
